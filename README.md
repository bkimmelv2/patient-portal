# Patient Portal App

A simple app to keep track of patients and thier vital signs!

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript, HTML, CSS 
- Node.js
- Mongoose
- Express
- EJS

## Approach Taken

This app uses all 7 RESTful routes and full CRUD functionality to organize and manage patient data. Using the combination of technologies above, the app will store user-input to a cloud database using Mongoose, display various views using EJS, and allow the user to manipulate all patient data using Express and its correlated web address routes.

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to open the website to a page listing all current patient names and ages.
- As a user, I want to click on a patient modal and be taken to a details page where I can see the selected patient's full details.
- As a user, i want to be able to edit the selected patients details by clicking the edit button at the bottom of the page.
- As a user, I want to be able to delete the selected patient's data by clicking the delete button at the bottom of the page.
- As a user, I want to be able to navigate to the home page at any time by clicking the button at the top of the page.
- As a user, I want to be able to create a new patient entry at any time by clicking the button at the top of the page.

## Future Goals

- I would like to add the ability to sort the index page by alphabetical order.
- I would like the vitals signs to turn into a red color whenever the input falls outside the normal range.
- I would like to add a chart view that gives a wider range of patient details including their reason for visit and a section to keep notes.
